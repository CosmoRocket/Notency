## <a id="OurClient"></a>Our Client

[Embassy English](https://www.embassyenglish.com/) is an organisation that seeks to provide teaching and resources for students learning English. They currently have schools in Australia, New Zealand, Canada, the UK and the USA.

## <a id="OurTask"></a>Our Task

Our client is looking for a web-based dashboard which would allow them to send notifications (via a service like SMS) and email announcements. The notifications are particularly critical, as they would allow the school to confirm the safety of their students in case of an emergency such as a flood. Since entering in each individual student into the system would be impractical, they would like to be able to upload student data via existing files, e.g. an excel spreadsheet containing the students' ids, names, phone numbers etc.

We set out to build a MERN stack application that would achieve these objectives.

## <a id="PlanningandWorkBreakdownandAllocation"></a>Planning and Work Breakdown and Allocation

We took an agile approach to organising our workflow, using Trello heavily to collect ideas and manage tasks.

We also used Trello to breakdown and allocate the workload based on our app's features and components.

Our approach to the project on a macro level was as follows:

* Whilst we prepared the wireframes, Glenn worked on the basic functionality for the backend such as sending SMS and emails.

* Once the wireframes were finalized, the rest of us figured out the components the application would have and developed each React component with styles and images needed by each component. These components could then be reused throughout the application. We ended up with a folder structure like this.

![Folder structure](docs/folder-structure.png)

* Once the components were in place, we assembled the various pages of the application using the individual components prepared in the previous step. Because we did this step, assembling was relatively easy and sort of like putting lego together. In taking this approach, we leveraged the strengths of React components to our benefit.

* Finally, we connected the front end to the back end API and polished the UI and functionality.

### One-way Messaging

One-way communication is used for sending out Announcements. These announcements do not require the recipients to respond to the message.

![One-Way Messaging](docs/one-way-messaging.png)

### Two-way Messaging

Two-way communication is used for sending out Notifications. These notifications pertain to situations where the recipients need to respond to the message.

## <a id="Repositories"></a>Repositories

We decided to separate the back-end repository from the front-end repository as it was an easier way to manage our branches. It also gave us a clearer perspective in finding our errors and keeping the changes under control.

## <a id="NotencyAPI"></a>Notency API

The [Notency API](https://github.com/CosmoRocket/Notency-api/) is the Node.JS back-end for Notency Front-end. Our back-end uses Express, Mongoose and other several open-source libraries. It was created with test driven development in mind while using tools such as Flow and Jest. It also uses the async/await syntax for all its routes and API calls.

Notency API makes use of Twilio for sending text messages and Mailgun for sending e-mail messages. These APIs are the foundation of our Notification and Announcement features and it completes the main essential of our app which is to have two-way communication with its customers.

### Setting up Notency API

1. Git clone https://github.com/CosmoRocket/Notency-api.git
2. Create a .env file containing the following keys in the root folder

```
JWT_SECRET =

## <a id="PostProjectReview"></a>Post Project Review

### Summary

This project presented us with interesting features to implement such as sending SMS and tracking responses and therefore was a very valuable learning opportunity. Doing the project for a real client helped us train soft skills such as communication, planning, scoping to a minimum viable product, time management, getting feedback, etc.

The scope of the project was perfect for the time allowed whilst challenging at the same time.

We encountered quite a few technical challenges along the way. Below, we have documented our thought processes and how we resolved these issues.

### Communication with the client

We managed to communicate regularly with the client by email and meetings to get instructions and confirmation as we went along. We were very fortunate in that our client was very responsive to our questions and emails, which made the whole process a lot smoother for us.

### Collaboration as a team

We worked well together as a team and as a result were on schedule in completing the prototype of the application. We had regular discussions regarding the design, wireframes, approach, how to go about implementing features, etc. In doing so, we avoided replicating efforts.

We pair-programmed when appropriate which helped each other detect bugs in the program.

We used git and github mostly without much trouble, merging work as features were completed. There was just one time where we had trouble syncing our work due to a delayed pull but that was eventually resolved.

### Introducing new libraries

At one stage, one of the group members introduced a new library called Formik to manage form state in React which resulted in unfamiliar code being added to important parts of the codebase.

Introducing libraries made life easier on the one hand but was a challenge on the other hand especially when other team members tried to read and introduce other features on top of the existing code.

In these circumstances, it was important to have the person who introduced the new library to be involved in writing the new code by pair programming for example and to explain how the new library works.

### Use of the Chrome developer tools

One of the more time consuming and frustrating features to implement was dealing with all the edge cases of filtering recipients by group such as role, nationality, graduation date on the front end. Using the Chrome developer tools was extremely helpful in tracking the props and state changes in the app whilst developing this feature. So often, this was better than littering `console.log` statements throughout the app.

### Tracking SMS responses

A key feature of our app was being able to track SMS responses coming back from recipients. One of the challenges that came up during group discussions was how to associate SMS responses coming back with a particular notification given that SMS responses do not store any application state.

We considered two possible solutions:

1. Generate a short unique code for the student to type in which would link to a notification sent out

2. Have multiple numbers, where a notification is assigned a number and the numbers are rotated through as new notifications are created. The Sent number can then easily be connected to a notification.

We chose the first option as we could only test with one number with the trial TWilio account, though left open the possibility of adding more numbers through Twilio.

### Email Attachments

Getting email attachments to work was time consuming especially as we did not have a clear idea of what was involved in implementing the functionality. In the absence of clear guidance, documentation and tutorials, we had to take a step back and think through the whole process ourselves before implementing the feature. It was only by doing this that we could push through the knowledge gap and technical issues along the way.

After extensive research and multiple failed attempts, we learned that there are 3 main steps involved in sending an email with attachments: Submitting the file, saving the file to the app and attaching it in the email. We submitted the attachment using a FormData object and processed that on the back end using Multer. Multer would give us access to the file in `req.file` and save that file to a temporary folder in the app, which could then be attached to the email.

### Deleting Recipients vs Activating/Deactivating Recipients

The list of students/teachers at Embassy English gets updated quite frequently as new students enroll and existing students graduate on a weekly basis.
One challenging decision we faced related to this was whether to totally replace all recipients in the database from the excel file or keep all users on the database and just activate/deactivate users.

Clarity came midway through the project when we realized the implications of deleting recipients from the database. This would mean some notifications would have IDs without corresponding recipients, as they would have been deleted. So this ruled out the option of deleting recipients.

On the other hand, if we were to let the list of recipients grow, students who had graduated or dropped out would still receive messages. The solution we decided to implement that made the most sense was to have a boolean attribute `active`, which would be `true` if the student was still on the list and `false` if not. On the back-end, we would need to have a route such as `/recipients/active` which would run a query to retrieve only "active" recipients.
